# AE-Telex
Monome Teletype for the AE modular ecosystem

Work in progress, first version seems to tentatively work pretty well.
Not too many major changes required, as most of the Teletype innards run off a regulated 5v / 3.3v anyway. Changed the op-amp scaling as appropriate for a 0-5v world. Still, recreating the whole schematic from scratch was quite a task!

Loads of testing required before this is a confirmed 'thing', but feel free to take, inspect, and improve as you wish.
